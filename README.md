Those 4 codes make the next things:
CODE 1.- Elaborate a codon usage table
CODE 2.- Filter FASTA and do Chi-Square
CODE 3.- Show base composition, total and mean exon length and mean number of exon and intron
CODE 4.- Show all sequences that doesn't start with ATG, those that doesn't finish with TAA, TAG or TGA and second codons
